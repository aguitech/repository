A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/run-time/pen/rzGgb.

 I made this pen for my awesome cousin on his birthday!  Everything should automatically size to fit the view port and the fire text is editable.  Tip: try blowing out the candles using the [delete] key.  Pro-Tip: try making a valid hex color in the candle flames.
